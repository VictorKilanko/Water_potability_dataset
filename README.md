# Water_potability_dataset
A classification project using 3 machine learning algorithms to determine if a body of water is safe to drink or not.

The dataset contains several water features that will be used to classify the water bodies on potability. I balanced the dataset set and scaled my X variables. Then, I used decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost models. XGBoost was the best with an almost 100% accuracy score. My most important features are pH, sulphate, hardness, and solids.
My final model was later successfully applied to a new dataset.
